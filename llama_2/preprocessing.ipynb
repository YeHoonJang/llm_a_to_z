      "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we work, play, and connect with each other. Increasingly, companies are opting for a remote work model, leading to the rise of digital nomadism. The benefits of remote work are numerous, giving people the flexibility to choose where they live and tailor their work environment to their own preferences. This shift also has implications for businesses, as they need to rethink the traditional office space, adapt their management practices, and embrace new technologies. However, this new mode of working also introduces challenges, such as ensuring proper communication and collaboration, providing adequate IT security measures, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance for employees.\n",

      "[|Human|] Yes, I have, but I feel like I could be doing more.\n",
      "[|AI|] Have you considered attending church more frequently or joining a Bible study group? It can be helpful to surround yourself with others who share similar beliefs and can provide support and guidance.\n",

      "[|Human|] No, I haven't. Could you show me an example of how to do that?\n",
      "[|AI|] Certainly! Here's an example code snippet that should do what you're looking for:\n",

      "```\n",
      "var copyText = \"\";\n",
      "\n",

      "[|AI|] Encephaloceles are a rare birth defect where a portion of the brain protrudes through an opening in the skull. To answer your question, there are various clinical trials that are ongoing for Encephaloceles.\n",
      "[|Human|] Can you give me some examples of these clinical trials?\n",
      "[|AI|] Sure! One study is investigating the surgical management of Encephaloceles. Another clinical trial is exploring the effectiveness of prenatal diagnosis of Encephaloceles using advanced ultrasound techniques. There are also studies looking into genetic causes of Encephaloceles.\n",
